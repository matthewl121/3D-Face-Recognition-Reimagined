# Please Read

This is my ECE 57000 Final Project, 3D Facial Recognition. All instructions to run the script can be found in the .ipynb file. Enjoy!

# For Revisions

Practically a lot of my code changed.  Since I don't know how to highlight code, I have documented it for you.  

All code containing training, testing, and demo have been compiled into a documented jupyter notebook (.ipynb file) with steps and explanations of throughout each cell.  I have also deleted everything regarding CUDA, but have chosen to leave the methodology and results of it in the paper since it played a significant role in my project.  Additionally, I have planned to train the model using a CNN approach instead of the using FaceNet and/or other public training tools available when it comes to facial detection.

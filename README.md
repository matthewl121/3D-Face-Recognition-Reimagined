# Please Read

This is my ECE 57000 Final Project, 3D Facial Recognition. All instructions to run the script can be found in the .ipynb file. Enjoy!

# For Revisions

Practically a lot of my code changed.  Since I don't know how to highlight code, I have documented it for you.  

My entire project was rewritten, but the reimplementation technique remained the same with slight differences which is explained later in this readme.  All code containing training, testing, and demo have been compiled into a documented jupyter notebook (.ipynb file) with steps and explanations shown throughout each cell.  I have also deleted everything regarding CUDA, but have chosen to leave the methodology and results of it in the paper since it played a significant role in my project.  Additionally, I trained the model using a CNN approach instead of the using FaceNet and/or other public training tools available which played a more effective role.  On of the biggest key differences between my result now and before is how I got the CNN model to work, and how effective it was when tested on images and webcam.
